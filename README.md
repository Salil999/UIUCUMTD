#h1 UIUCUMTD
Bus app for the Pebble smartwatch. Made by a UIUC student for UIUC students.

# Technical Details
Used CloudPebble IDE to develop the app entirely in JavaScript. In the src folder, there are 2 files:
>min.js
and
>app.js

The read-able code is in app.js, but the actual app on te phone (and the app on the Pebble store) is min.js
