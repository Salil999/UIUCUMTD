# UIUCUMTD
Bus app for the Pebble smartwatch. Made by a UIUC student for UIUC students.



# Technical Details
Used CloudPebble IDE to develop the app entirely in JavaScript. In the src folder, there are 2 files:
+ min.js
+ app.js

The readable code is in app.js, but the actual app on te phone (and the app on the Pebble store) is min.js

I submitted min.js because it's a smaller file (hence min -> minified)
